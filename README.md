glo2048
===

A website to play a 2048 game inside of a Glo Board using it's API. 

I am using PHP 7.2 and the symfony framework to take care of the game engine and api calls. The glo board is inserted in an iframe and glo automaticaly refresh when the board is updated.

There is probably a few bugs and security was not my primary goal, so please use at your own risk.
